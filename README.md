# Weapon-Based Game

## Overview  
I made this quirky little Java game as a fun way to practice and showcase the core pillars of Java OOP — inheritance, method overriding, upcasting, and all that jazz. You click on weapons, see some magic happen, and secretly learn Java concepts without even realizing it!

## Features  
- Clickable weapons — because who doesn’t like clicking stuff?  
- Shows off inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, and has-a relationships  
- Clean, modular code that even your future self will thank you for  

## Technologies Used  
- Core Java (Classes, Objects, Constructors, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Upcasting)  
- Interfaces and SOLID principles (yeah, I’m trying to be fancy)  

## How to Run  
1. Clone the repo  
2. Compile the Java files  
3. Run the main class and enjoy clicking weapons!
